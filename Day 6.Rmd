```

## R Markdown

```{r}
print ("R Markdown")
```
### 1. R vector

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
### 3. R matrix
`Function - matrix()`
```{r}
matrix()
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
matrix[2, 3]
```{r}
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
### R Array
```{r}
array(data = NA, dim = length(data) , dimname =null)
```
